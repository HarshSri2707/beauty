      <ul>
        <li>Start with a <b>gentle, non-comedogenic cleanser</b> to remove excess oil and impurities without stripping the skin.</li>
        <li>Use targeted treatments containing <b>benzoyl peroxide</b> to kill acne-causing bacteria or <b>salicylic acid</b> to unclog pores and reduce inflammation.</li>
        <li>Apply a <b>lightweight, non-comedogenic moisturizer</b> to hydrate without clogging pores, and use a daily <b>broad-spectrum SPF</b> to protect against scarring and hyperpigmentation.</li>
